# Home_automation_sub_Hand_gesture_Minor_project
This is just a small part of the big project of home automation, that me and my mates are working on in the college, but this small part is a project on its own!
Full Project of Home Automation is Work in Progress currently.

## Introduction

This project aims to recognize and classify hand gestures using OpenCV and Python. The model can detect and classify various hand gestures like fist, open palm, thumbs up, and more. The project can be used for applications such as sign language recognition, gesture-based computer control, and other human-computer interaction applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV 4.5.3
- NumPy 1.21.1

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Aryan570/Hand_gesture_Minor_project.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   $ pip install opencv-python==4.5.3.56 numpy==1.21.1
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   $ cd Hand_gesture_Minor_project
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```
   $ python main.py
   ```

3. Place your hand in front of the camera and perform any gesture. The program will display the predicted gesture.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature`)
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`)
